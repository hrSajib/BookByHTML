<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Farmer Meanwell was at one time a very rich man. He owned large fields,</p>
<p class="p1">and had fine flocks of sheep, and plenty of money. But all at once his</p>
<p class="p1">good fortune seemed to desert him. Year after year his crops failed, his</p>
<p class="p1">sheep died off, and he was obliged to borrow money to pay his rent and</p>
<p class="p1">the wages of those who worked on the farm.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;At last he had to sell his farm, but even this did not bring him in</p>
<p class="p1">money enough to pay his debts, and he was worse off than ever.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Among those who had lent money to Farmer Meanwell were Sir Thomas Gripe,</p>
<p class="p1">and a Farmer named Graspall.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Sir Thomas was a very rich man indeed, and Farmer Graspall had more</p>
<p class="p1">money than he could possibly use. But they were both very greedy and</p>
<p class="p1">covetous, and particularly hard on those who owed them anything. Farmer</p>
<p class="p1">Graspall abused Farmer Meanwell and called him all sorts of dreadful</p>
<p class="p1">names; but the rich Sir Thomas Gripe was more cruel still, and wanted</p>
<p class="p1">the poor debtor shut up in jail.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;So poor Farmer Meanwell had to hasten from the place where he had lived</p>
<p class="p1">for so many years, in order to get out of the way of these greedy men.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;He went to the next village, taking his wife and his two little children</p>
<p class="p1">with him. But though he was free from Gripe and Graspall he was not free</p>
<p class="p1">from trouble and care.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;He soon fell ill, and when he found himself unable to get food and</p>
<p class="p1">clothes for his family, he grew worse and worse and soon died.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;His wife could not bear the loss of her husband, whom she loved so</p>
<p class="p1">dearly, and in a few days she was dead.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The two orphan children seemed to be left entirely alone in the world,</p>
<p class="p1">with no one to look after them, or care for them, but their Heavenly</p>
<p class="p1">Father.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They trotted around hand in hand, and the poorer they became the more</p>
<p class="p1">they clung to each other. Poor, ragged, and hungry enough they were!&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Tommy had two shoes, but Margery went barefoot. They had nothing to eat</p>
<p class="p1">but the berries that grew in the woods, and the scraps they could get</p>
<p class="p1">from the poor people in the village, and at night they slept in barns or</p>
<p class="p1">under hay-stacks.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Their rich relations were too proud to notice them. But Mr. Smith, the</p>
<p class="p1">clergyman of the village where the children were born, was not that sort</p>
<p class="p1">of a man. A rich relation came to visit him&amp;mdash;a kind-hearted</p>
<p class="p1">gentleman&amp;mdash;and the clergyman told him all about Tommy and Margery. The</p>
<p class="p1">kind gentleman pitied them, and ordered Margery a pair of shoes and gave</p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Smith money to buy her some clothes, which she needed sadly. As for</p>
<p class="p1">Tommy he said he would take him off to sea with him and make him a</p>
<p class="p1">sailor. After a few days, the gentleman said he must go to London and</p>
<p class="p1">would take Tommy with him, and sad was the parting between the two</p>
<p class="p1">children.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Poor Margery was very lonely indeed, without her brother, and might have</p>
<p class="p1">cried herself sick but for the new shoes that were brought home to her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;div class="figcenter"&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>&lt;a href="images/img04.jpg"&gt;&lt;img</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>src="images/img04-tb.jpg" width="286" height="400"</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They turned her thoughts from her grief; and as soon as she had put</p>
<p class="p1">them on she ran in to Mrs. Smith and cried out: "Two shoes, ma'am, two</p>
<p class="p1">shoes!" These words she repeated to every one she met, and thus it was</p>
<p class="p1">she got the name of Goody Two Shoes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;div class="figcenter"&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>&lt;a href="images/img05.jpg"&gt;&lt;img</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>src="images/img05-tb.jpg" width="282" height="400"</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>alt="The Orphans" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>&lt;b&gt;Two Shoes, Ma'am. Two Shoes.&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Little Margery had seen how good and wise Mr. Smith was, and thought it</p>
<p class="p1">was because of his great learning; and she wanted, above all things, to</p>
<p class="p1">learn to read. At last she made up her mind to ask Mr. Smith to teach</p>
<p class="p1">her when he had a moment to spare. He readily agreed to do this, and</p>
<p class="p1">Margery read to him an hour every day, and spent much time with her</p>
<p class="p1">books.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Then she laid out a plan for teaching others more ignorant than herself.</p>
<p class="p1">She cut out of thin pieces of wood ten sets of large and small letters</p>
<p class="p1">of the alphabet, and carried these with her when she went from house to</p>
<p class="p1">house. When she came to Billy Wilson's she threw down the letters all in</p>
<p class="p1">a heap, and Billy picked them out and sorted them in lines, thus:&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;div class='centered'&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="2" width="50%" cellspacing="0" summary="large and small letters</p>
<p class="p1">of the alphabet"&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;E&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;F&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;G&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;H&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;I&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;J&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;K,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;a&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;b&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;d&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;e&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;f&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;g&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;h&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;i&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;j&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align='left'&gt;k,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;and so on until all the letters were in their right places.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;From there Goody Two Shoes trotted off to another cottage, and here were</p>
<p class="p1">several children waiting for her. As soon as the little girl came in</p>
<p class="p1">they all crowded around her, and were eager to begin their lessons at</p>
<p class="p1">once.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Then she threw the letters down and said to the boy next her, "What did</p>
<p class="p1">you have for dinner to-day?" "Bread," answered the little boy. "Well,</p>
<p class="p1">put down the first letter," said Goody Two Shoes. Then he put down B,</p>
<p class="p1">and the next child R, and the next E, and the next A, and the next D,</p>
<p class="p1">and there was the whole word&amp;mdash;BREAD.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"What did you have for dinner, Polly Driggs?"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;"Apple-pie," said Polly; upon which she laid down the first letter, A,</p>
<p class="p1">and the next put down a P, and the next another P, and so on until the</p>
<p class="p1">words Apple and Pie were united, and stood thus: APPLE PIE.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Now it happened one evening that Goody Two Shoes was going home rather</p>
<p class="p1">late. She had made a longer round than usual, and everybody had kept her</p>
<p class="p1">waiting, so that night came on before her day's work was done. Right</p>
<p class="p1">glad was she to set out for her own home, and she walked along</p>
<p class="p1">contentedly through the fields, and lanes, and roads, enjoying the quiet</p>
<p class="p1">evening. The evening was not cool, however, but close and sultry, and</p>
<p class="p1">betokened a storm. Presently a drop fell on Goody's face. What should</p>
<p class="p1">she do? If she did not make haste she would soon be wet to the skin.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Fortunately there was an old barn down the road, in which she could find</p>
<p class="p1">shelter, and Goody Two Shoes gathered her skirts about her and took to</p>
<p class="p1">her heels, and ran as if somebody was after her. The owner of the barn</p>
<p class="p1">had died lately, and the property was to be sold, and there was a lot of</p>
<p class="p1">loose hay on the floor which had not yet been taken away.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Goody Two Shoes cuddled down in the soft hay, glad of a chance to rest</p>
<p class="p1">her weary limbs, and quite out of breath with her long run; and just</p>
<p class="p1">then down rattled the rain, the thunder roared, the lightning flashed,</p>
<p class="p1">and the old barn trembled, and so did Goody Two Shoes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;div class="figcenter"&gt;</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;She had not been there long before she heard footsteps, and three men</p>
<p class="p1">came into the barn for shelter. The hay was piled up between her and</p>
<p class="p1">them, so that they could not see her, and, thinking they were alone,</p>
<p class="p1">they spoke quite loudly.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;div class="figcenter"&gt;</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span>&lt;b&gt;Plotting to rob Squire Trueman&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They were plotting to rob Squire Trueman, who lived in the great house</p>
<p class="p1">in Margery's village, and were to break in and steal all they could that</p>
<p class="p1">very night. This was quite enough for Goody Two Shoes. She waited for</p>
<p class="p1">nothing, but dashed out of the barn, and ran through rain and mud till</p>
<p class="p1">she came to the Squire's house.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;He was at dinner with some friends, and any one else but Goody would</p>
<p class="p1">have found it difficult to gain admission to him. But she was well known</p>
<p class="p1">to the servants, and was so kind and obliging, that even the big fat</p>
<p class="p1">butler could not refuse to do her bidding, and went and told the squire</p>
<p class="p1">that Goody Two Shoes wished very much to see him.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;So the squire asked his friends to excuse him for a moment, and came out</p>
<p class="p1">and said, "Well, Goody Two Shoes, my good girl, what is it?" "Oh, sir,"</p>
<p class="p1">she replied, "if you do not take care you will be robbed and murdered</p>
<p class="p1">this very night!"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Then she told all she had heard the men say while she was in the barn.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The squire saw there was not a moment to lose, so he went back and told</p>
<p class="p1">his friends the news he had heard. They all said they would stay and</p>
<p class="p1">help him take the thieves. So the lights were put out, to make it appear</p>
<p class="p1">as if all the people in the house were in bed, and servants and all kept</p>
<p class="p1">a close watch both inside and outside.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, at about one o'clock in the morning the three men came</p>
<p class="p1">creeping, creeping up to the house with a dark lantern, and the tools to</p>
<p class="p1">break in with. Before they were aware, six men sprang out on them, and</p>
<p class="p1">held them fast. The thieves struggled in vain to get away. They were</p>
<p class="p1">locked in an out-house until daylight, when a cart came and took them</p>
<p class="p1">off to jail.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;They were afterward sent out of the country, where they had to work in</p>
<p class="p1">chains on the roads; and it is said that one of them behaved so well</p>
<p class="p1">that he was pardoned, and went to live at Australia, where he became a</p>
<p class="p1">rich man.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The other two went from bad to worse, and it is likely that they came to</p>
<p class="p1">some dreadful end. For sin never goes unpunished.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;But to return to Goody Two Shoes. One day as she was walking through the</p>
<p class="p1">village she saw some wicked boys with a raven, at which they were going</p>
<p class="p1">to throw stones. To stop this cruel sport she gave the boys a penny for</p>
<p class="p1">the raven, and brought the bird home with her. She gave him the name of</p>
<p class="p1">"Ralph," and he proved to be a very clever creature indeed. She taught</p>
<p class="p1">him to spell, and to read, and he was so fond of playing with the large</p>
<p class="p1">letters, that the children called them "Ralph's Alphabet."&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Some days after Goody had met with the raven, she was passing through a</p>
<p class="p1">field, when she saw some naughty boys who had taken a pigeon, and tied a</p>
<p class="p1">string to its legs in order to let it fly and draw it back again when</p>
<p class="p1">they pleased.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Goody could not bear to see anything tortured like that, so she bought</p>
<p class="p1">the pigeon from the boys and taught him how to spell and read. But he</p>
<p class="p1">could not talk. And as Ralph, the raven, took the large letters, Peter,</p>
<p class="p1">the pigeon, took care of the small ones.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;div class="figcenter"&gt;</p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Williams, who lived in Margery's village, kept school, and taught</p>
<p class="p1">little ones their A B C's. She was now old and feeble, and wanted to</p>
<p class="p1">give up this important trust.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;div class="figcenter"&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>&lt;a href="images/img013.jpg"&gt;&lt;img</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;This being known to Sir William Dove, he asked Mrs. Williams to examine</p>
<p class="p1">Goody Two Shoes and see if she was not clever enough for the office.</p>
<p class="p1">This was done, and Mrs. Williams reported that little Margery was the</p>
<p class="p1">best scholar, and had the best heart of any one she had ever examined.</p>
<p class="p1">All the country had a great opinion of Mrs. Williams, and this report</p>
<p class="p1">made them think highly of Miss MARGERY, as we must now call her.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;So Margery Meanwell was now a schoolmistress, and a capital one she</p>
<p class="p1">made. The children all loved her, for she was never weary of making</p>
<p class="p1">plans for their happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The room in which she taught was large and lofty, and there was plenty</p>
<p class="p1">of fresh air in it; and as she knew that children liked to move about,</p>
<p class="p1">she placed her sets of letters all round the school, so that every one</p>
<p class="p1">was obliged to get up to find a letter, or spell a word, when it came</p>
<p class="p1">their turn.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;This exercise not only kept the children in good health, but fixed the</p>
<p class="p1">letters firmly in their minds.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The neighbors were very good to her, and one of them made her a present</p>
<p class="p1">of a little skylark, whose early morning song told the lazy boys and</p>
<p class="p1">girls that it was time they were out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Some time after this a poor lamb lost its dam, and the farmer being</p>
<p class="p1">about to kill it, she bought it of him, and brought it home to play with</p>
<p class="p1">the children.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Soon after this a present was made to Miss Margery of a dog, and as he</p>
<p class="p1">was always in good humor, and always jumping about, the children gave</p>
<p class="p1">him the name of Jumper. It was his duty to guard the door, and no one</p>
<p class="p1">could go out or come in without leave from his mistress.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Margery was so wise and good that some foolish people accused her of</p>
<p class="p1">being a witch, and she was taken to court and tried before the judge.</p>
<p class="p1">She soon proved that she was a most sensible woman, and Sir Charles</p>
<p class="p1">Jones was so pleased with her, that he offered her a large sum of money</p>
<p class="p1">to take care of his family, and educate his daughter. At first she</p>
<p class="p1">refused, but afterwards went and behaved so well, and was so kind and</p>
<p class="p1">tender, that Sir Charles would not permit her to leave the house, and</p>
<p class="p1">soon after made her an offer of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;The neighbors came in crowds to the wedding, and all were glad that one</p>
<p class="p1">who had been such a good girl, and had grown up such a good woman, was</p>
<p class="p1">to become a grand lady.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Just as the clergyman had opened his book, a gentleman, richly dressed,</p>
<p class="p1">ran into the church and cried, "Stop! stop!"&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Great alarm was felt, especially by the bride and groom, with whom he</p>
<p class="p1">said he wished to speak privately.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Sir Charles stood motionless with surprise, and the bride fainted away</p>
<p class="p1">in the stranger's arms. For this richly-dressed gentleman turned out to</p>
<p class="p1">be little Tommy Meanwell, who had just come from sea, where he had made</p>
<p class="p1">a large fortune.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Sir Charles and Lady Jones lived very happily together, and the great</p>
<p class="p1">lady did not forget the children, but was just as good to them as she</p>
<p class="p1">had always been. She was also kind and good to the poor, and the sick,</p>
<p class="p1">and a friend to all who were in distress. Her life was a great blessing,</p>
<p class="p1">and her death the greatest calamity that ever took place in the</p>
<p class="p1">neighborhood where she lived, and was known as&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;h3&gt;</p>
